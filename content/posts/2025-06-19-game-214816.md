The excitement in the anime gaming community is palpable as Crunchyroll announces the upcoming release of the mobile puzzle game, *Classroom of the Elite ~Merge Puzzle Special Exam~*. Set to join the Crunchyroll Game Vault, this game promises a rich experience with features like full voice-acting, character progression, and immersive story contentâ€”all without the burden of microtransactions. Pre-registration is now open on both the App Store and Google Play, allowing eager fans to secure their spot ahead of the game's launch.

Originally released in Japan in February 2024, the game introduces players to "school miniscapes" that unlock through scenario progression, enhancing the gameplay experience.
