Skateboarding is more than just a sport; it's a lifestyle that fosters community and promotes physical health. Jimmy Jarvis, owner of Triple S Skate Co., embodies this spirit as he aims to raise awareness about the benefits of skateboarding. With his shop located in Bartlett, Jarvis is not only providing a space for enthusiasts but also serving as a catalyst for the sport's growth in the area.

Having skateboarded since the age of nine, Jarvis reflects on how the now-closed Skate Park of Memphis shaped his childhood and friendships. His passion for skateboarding drives him to create a welcoming environment for both newcomers and seasoned skaters alike. As skateboarding continues to gain traction globally, its exciting to think about how it can unite communities and inspire healthier lifestyles. Will we see more skate parks and initiatives like Jarvis's in the future?
