A Nintendo Direct presentation is reportedly set for mid-September, and this could be a game-changer for fans eagerly awaiting updates on major titles. With the anticipated date possibly falling on September 12, just one day before the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros, the excitement is palpable. This timing not only celebrates a significant milestone in gaming history but also sets the stage for potential big announcements.

While the specifics of the presentation remain under wraps, speculation is rife that we may finally get a release date for Metroid Prime 4.
