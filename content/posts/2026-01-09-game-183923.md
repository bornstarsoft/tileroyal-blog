The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Daniel Knight, the creator of the hit game Phasmophobia, announces the launch of Kinetic Publishing. This new publishing label aims to support indie developers while firmly rejecting AI-generated content and blockchain elements. Knight's vision is clear: to champion creativity and provide a nurturing environment for indie games, allowing developers to maintain their artistic integrity.

Kinetic Publishing is particularly focused on projects that are 12-18 months away from completion, offering not just funding but also advisory support to help developers realize their visions. With a team that has grown to 40 members since the success of Phasmophobia, Knight is poised to make a significant impact in the indie gaming scene. Asim Tanvir, the new director of marketing and partnerships, emphasizes the importance of supporting creativity across various genres, from cozy games to RPGs.

As the indie gaming landscape continues to evolve, Kinetic Publishing's commitment to fostering genuine creativity without the influence of AI or blockchain could set a new standard. Will this initiative inspire a wave of innovative indie games that resonate with players worldwide?
