November 2025 marked a historic low for hardware sales in the US, with only 1.6 million units sold, the worst performance since 1995. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including an all-time high average price of $439 for new gaming consoles, which has deterred many potential buyers during what is typically a peak shopping season.

The PlayStation 5 led the sales charts, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S, but overall spending on hardware fell by 27% compared to last year. Additionally, physical software sales also plummeted, indicating a broader trend towards digital purchases. As the gaming industry grapples with rising prices and declining sales, the future of dedicated gaming devices may be at risk. Will manufacturers find a way to lower prices, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in how games are consumed?
