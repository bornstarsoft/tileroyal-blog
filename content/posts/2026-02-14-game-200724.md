The 2026 Taipei International Game Show showcased the vibrant world of gaming culture, with the "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium" booth standing out as a highlight. This booth not only featured an impressive array of cosplayers but also engaged fans with interactive elements like a Memory Puzzle Game that rewards players based on their commander level in the app.

Cosplayers brought beloved characters to life, including the striking "Macchiato" and the playful "Sentau Lacey" in a swimsuit, captivating attendees. The presence of characters like "Suomi" and "Kunkai" in both swimsuit and battle attire added a unique flair to the booth, making it a must-visit for fans. The atmosphere was electric, with fans eagerly snapping photos with their favorite characters, creating memorable experiences.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like these not only celebrate gaming but also foster a sense of community among fans and creators. What other surprises might the gaming industry have in store for us in the future?
