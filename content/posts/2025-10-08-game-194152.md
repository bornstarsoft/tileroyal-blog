A charity quiz night has become a beacon of hope and community spirit, raising over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. Organized by the North East fundraising group, this annual event brings together teams from across the region to compete in a fun and engaging quiz, all while supporting a noble cause. The funds generated from this event directly contribute to Marie Curie's essential services, including nursing care and hospice support for those facing terminal illnesses.

The quiz night has not only become a cherished tradition but also a testament to the power of community involvement. Each year, teams return, showcasing their commitment to making a difference in the lives of patients and their families. Marie Curie has expressed immense gratitude to all participants who have contributed to this significant achievement, highlighting how collective efforts can lead to remarkable outcomes.

As we reflect on the success of this event, it raises an important question: how can we leverage technology and social media to further enhance community fundraising efforts? The future of charitable events may very well depend on our ability to innovate and engage more people in meaningful ways.
