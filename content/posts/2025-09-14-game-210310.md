Nintendo is making waves in the gaming community by announcing the addition of the Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. This nostalgic accessory, which replicates the original 1995 Virtual Boy console, will allow players to experience classic games like Marios Tennis and Wario Land in a whole new way. Set to launch on February 17, 2026, this move not only revives a long-forgotten console but also introduces a unique physical accessory that gamers will need to enjoy these titles.

The dedicated Virtual Boy accessory will retail for $100, while a more affordable cardboard model will be available for $25. This strategy seems to cater to both hardcore collectors and casual gamers, making the experience accessible to a broader audience. With 14 games promised to be released over time, including favorites like Galactic Pinball and V Tetris, the excitement is palpable among fans eager to relive the past.

Despite its rocky history as one of Nintendo's biggest commercial failures, the Virtual Boy's revival could signify a new era of retro gaming on modern platforms. Will this nostalgic accessory reignite interest in virtual reality gaming, or will it remain a quirky footnote in gaming history? Only time will tell.
