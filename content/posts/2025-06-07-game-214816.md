Get ready to rethink your work-from-home experience with Pocket Boss, an innovative puzzle game that transforms the often mundane world of corporate data manipulation into an engaging challenge. Recently announced during the Day of the Devs showcase at Summer Game Fest, this game promises to deliver a unique blend of humor and strategy as players navigate the demands of an overbearing boss while juggling data changes to maximize profits.

Set primarily within a chat window, Pocket Boss immerses players in the life of a remote employee who must tackle various minigames that reflect the absurdities of corporate life. From flinging competitors' market shares off the screen to skillfully maneuvering through a chaotic stock market, the game draws inspiration from the fast-paced WarioWare franchise, ensuring that each session is packed with excitement and unpredictability.

Published by Playables, the studio behind creative titles like Time Flies and KIDS, Pocket Boss is shaping up to be a must-play for anyone who enjoys a mix of strategy and humor in their gaming experience.
