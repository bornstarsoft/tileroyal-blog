In a shocking turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could affect over 100 employees. This news comes on the heels of a rocky launch for MindsEye, which has been plagued by technical issues and bugs, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among players and even refunds from PlayStation.

According to sources cited by IGN, the Edinburgh-based developer has begun a 45-day consultation process, a legal requirement in the UK when laying off 100 or more staff. This situation raises serious concerns about the studio's future and the impact of game quality on employee stability. With an estimated 300 employees in the UK and an additional 200 overseas, the potential layoffs could significantly alter the landscape of this ambitious studio.

The backlash against MindsEye has been intense, with social media flooded with videos showcasing its myriad of technical problems. The studio's heartfelt apology earlier this month highlights their commitment to player experience, but the question remains: can they turn things around before it's too late? As the gaming community watches closely, the fate of Build a Rocket Boy hangs in the balance.
