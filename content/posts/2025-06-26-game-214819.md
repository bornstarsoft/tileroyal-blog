In a surprising turn of events, Intellivision's much-anticipated Amico console is still on track for release, despite ongoing financial hurdles. The company has recently made headlines by launching several of its games on the Nintendo Switch and Steam, including the stunt jumping game Evel Knievel and the platformer Finnigan Fox. This strategic move not only keeps the brand alive but also allows gamers to enjoy family-friendly titles while they await the console's debut.

Originally slated for release in October 2020, the Amico has faced multiple delays, with the company even selling boxed versions of its launch games before the console was available. Now rebranded as Amico Entertainment after selling the Intellivision brand to Atari, the company is determined to move forward. Their new mobile app, Amico Home, further expands access to their games, allowing iOS and Android users to purchase titles initially intended for the console.

The release of these games marks a significant milestone in Amico's journey, as they aim to bring families together through gaming. As they navigate these challenging waters, one can't help but wonder: will the Amico console eventually make its long-awaited debut, or will the focus remain on expanding their game library across platforms?
