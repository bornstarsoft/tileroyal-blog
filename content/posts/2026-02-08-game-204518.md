If youre a fan of puzzle games but often find them too challenging, youll want to check out Botany Manor, which is currently free on the Epic Games Store. This cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research.

The developers have crafted a game that emphasizes exploration and discovery without overwhelming players with difficulty. Laure De May, the lead developer, mentioned that the challenge lies in the number of clues and steps rather than in the complexity of the puzzles themselves.
