The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as reliable insider billbil-kun has leaked the release date and price for the upcoming Switch 2 version of Assassins Creed Shadows. Scheduled for launch on December 5, 2025, this highly anticipated title will be available in both digital and physical formats, with the physical edition featuring a Game-Key card. Priced at approximately 50 in Europe, fans are eager to see how this translates to North American and UK markets.

With pre-orders expected to begin before November 7, the momentum is building for Ubisoft's official announcement. The recent listing on the PEGI website and a now-removed entry from French retailer Auchan have only fueled speculation about this exciting port. Following the success of Ubisofts Star Wars Outlaws on the Switch, players are hopeful for a similarly impressive experience with Assassins Creed Shadows.

As we await further confirmation from Ubisoft, the anticipation for Assassins Creed Shadows on Switch 2 raises an intriguing question: will this game help restore confidence in one of gaming's most iconic franchises? Stay tuned for more updates as the release date approaches!
