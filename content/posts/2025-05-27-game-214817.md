In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only sets high expectations but also highlights the ongoing demand for innovative puzzle games reminiscent of the beloved Portal series. With the original ChromaGun receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 release, anticipation is building for what this sequel will deliver.

ChromaGun 2 promises to offer a unique twist on the first-person puzzle genre. While it draws comparisons to Portal in terms of its setting—where players assist a company in testing new technology—the gameplay mechanics seem to align more closely with titles like Qube. Players will utilize a special gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, creating a vibrant and engaging experience. For those eager to dive in, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to get a taste of the colorful chaos that awaits.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the full release, one can't help but wonder: will ChromaGun 2 manage to carve its own niche in the puzzle genre, or will it be overshadowed by its predecessors? Only time will tell, but for now, the excitement is palpable.
