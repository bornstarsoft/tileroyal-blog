In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied reports of its closure, despite facing significant funding challenges. The studio, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, recently lost financial backing for its unannounced first-person shooter project after Microsoft pulled its publishing agreement. This led to speculation about the studio's future, with some employees claiming that the entire team was being laid off.

However, Romero Games has clarified that it is still operational and is actively exploring new publishing opportunities. In a statement, the studio emphasized that while the funding for their project was indeed withdrawn, they are in discussions with several interested publishers who could potentially revive the project. This proactive approach highlights the resilience of the studio and its commitment to its team and fans.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the situation at Romero Games serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of game development and funding. Will they find a new partner to bring their vision to life, or will this be a cautionary tale for other studios? Only time will tell.
