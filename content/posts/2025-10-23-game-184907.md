The recent patch for NASCAR 25 has finally addressed one of the most requested features by players: in-race pit stop adjustments. This long-awaited addition allows players to make critical adjustments to their car's tire pressure and wedge settings during the race, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. Previously, players could only make these adjustments before practice, qualifying, or race sessions, which limited their strategy options during the heat of competition.

Despite the excitement surrounding this update, it's important to note that the pit stop mechanics still have room for improvement. For instance, players are currently restricted to changing all four tires or just the right-side tires, with no option for left-side tire changes. Additionally, the animations for pit stops still reflect the single lug design of the NASCAR Next Gen Car, regardless of the series being raced. 

As developers continue to refine NASCAR 25, fans are hopeful that further updates will enhance the realism and strategic depth of pit stops. Will we see even more customization options in the future? Only time will tell.
