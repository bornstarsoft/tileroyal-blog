A new video game based on the iconic Friday the 13th franchise is officially in development, stirring excitement among fans of horror and gaming alike. During a recent San Diego Comic-Con panel, Robert Barsamian, executive vice president at Horror Inc, confirmed that both a sequel game and a new movie are on the horizon, marking a significant return for the franchise that has been dormant for years.

While details remain scarce, Barsamian hinted that the upcoming game may not be a direct follow-up to the 2017 title, Friday the 13th: The Game, which was pulled from sale after its licensing expired. This opens up intriguing possibilities for gameplay and story, especially as the newly formed Jason Universe aims to revitalize the character for modern audiences through various projects.

As we await more information, fans are left to ponder what this new installment will bring to the table. Will it capture the essence of its predecessor, or will it venture into new territory? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the return of Jason Voorhees in gaming is something to watch closely.
