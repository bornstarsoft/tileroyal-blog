The release of iRacing's NASCAR 25 Console Game marks a significant milestone for racing enthusiasts, particularly those who have been eagerly awaiting a multi-platform NASCAR experience since 2021. One of the standout features of this game is its impressive array of base paint schemes, which not only cater to a diverse selection of drivers but also include iconic sponsors that fans have longed to see back in the NASCAR gaming universe.

While the game does have some notable exclusions, such as cars featuring Monster Energy and alcoholic beverage sponsors, it compensates with a rich selection of fan-favorite designs. For instance, the return of Red Bull in a NASCAR game is a nostalgic nod to long-time fans, making this release feel both fresh and familiar. The inclusion of the ARCA Menards Series also broadens the scope of racing experiences available to players, enhancing the overall gameplay.

As we dive deeper into the world of NASCAR gaming, it will be interesting to see how iRacing continues to evolve its offerings and whether future updates will bring back some of the beloved paint schemes that are currently missing. What are your thoughts on the current lineup, and which paint schemes do you hope to see in the future?
