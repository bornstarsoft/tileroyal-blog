If youre someone who finds joy in tidying up and organizing, then the upcoming game Hozy might just be your perfect escape. This delightful sandbox puzzle game combines elements of cleaning and decorating, reminiscent of fan favorites like Unpacking and PowerWash Simulator. It offers players the unique opportunity to create their own aesthetically pleasing spaces while indulging in the satisfying act of cleaning.

In Hozy, each level presents a new room to tidy up, from spacious living rooms to cozy studio apartments. You can gather up clutter into floating rubbish balls and dispose of them in a whimsical Tardis-like bin. Once the cleaning is done, the real fun begins as you unpack furniture and decorate the space to your heart's content, all while enjoying the ambient sounds that enhance the relaxing experience.

While the game is still awaiting a release date, the early playtest reveals a charming and detailed environment that caters to those who appreciate order and creativity. As we look forward to its launch in 2026, one cant help but wonder: how will Hozy inspire players to express their unique styles in a world that thrives on chaos?
