The recent launch of CONCIERGE, a surrealist puzzle thriller from Brazilian developers KODINO Artes, has captivated gamers with its unique blend of horror and abstract storytelling. Available on Steam for just $12.99, this game invites players to explore a decrepit hotel fractured into six distinct realities, each offering its own set of mind-bending puzzles and challenges. What sets CONCIERGE apart is not just its gameplay but the intriguing riddle hidden within, offering a $500 bounty for the first player to solve it.

Players are armed with an unreliable camcorder and must navigate through broken timelines and cryptic guests, making every decision count in this nonlinear experience. As co-creator Yan Boente notes, the game is designed to respect players' curiosity and intuition, encouraging them to think outside the box without the aid of tutorials. This approach not only enhances engagement but also fosters a deeper connection to the game's narrative.

With a limited-time discount and a thrilling riddle challenge, CONCIERGE is more than just a game; it's an invitation to delve into the unknown and embrace the discomfort of unraveling its mysteries. Are you ready to confront your own perceptions and take on the challenge?
