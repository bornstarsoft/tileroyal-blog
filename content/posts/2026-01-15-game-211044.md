In an intriguing revelation, a player has discovered that installing all downloadable content (DLC) for Monster Hunter Wilds can significantly enhance the game's performance on PC. This finding stems from a Reddit post by user de_Tylmarande, who experienced drastic frame rate improvements when switching between accountsone with all DLC and another with just the base game. The player hypothesized that the games frequent checks for DLC ownership were causing performance drops, and that fewer checks resulted in smoother gameplay.

After conducting tests on multiple accounts and even creating a mod to bypass the DLC checks, de_Tylmarande confirmed that the game ran much better when it believed all DLC was present. This raises questions about how developers manage performance and the potential impact of DLC checks on user experience. With Capcom now aware of the issue, it remains to be seen whether they will address this bug in future updates, potentially improving the gaming experience for many players.

As the gaming community awaits Capcom's response, one has to wonder: could this be a widespread issue affecting other titles as well? What do you think about the implications of such performance discrepancies in modern gaming?
