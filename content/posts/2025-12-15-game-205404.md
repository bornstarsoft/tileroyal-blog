In an exciting turn of events for retro gaming enthusiasts, the long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback. Thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation, this unreleased title will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100. This release not only revives a piece of gaming history but also supports the vital archival efforts of the VGHF.

The 2025 release of Xcavator includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled past, Oberth's career, and the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history. This initiative highlights the importance of preserving our gaming heritage, ensuring that future generations can appreciate the creativity and innovation of past developers.

As we look forward to the release, it raises an intriguing question: how many more hidden gems from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with the world?
