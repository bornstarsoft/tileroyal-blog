In a bold move reminiscent of the gaming industry's thirst for a true sequel to Portal 2, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**. Their cheeky claim, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did," speaks volumes about the anticipation surrounding this new title. While Valve has left fans hanging with their reluctance to produce a third installment, ChromaGun 2 aims to fill that void with its unique take on puzzle-solving gameplay.

The game features an FPS mechanic where players utilize a colorful gun to manipulate objects, creating a vibrant world reminiscent of Portal's testing chambers. However, the gameplay seems to draw more inspiration from titles like Qube and Qube 2, focusing on color-based puzzles rather than the iconic portals that defined the original Portal series. This fresh approach could attract both fans of the original games and newcomers alike, eager to dive into a world of creative problem-solving.

ChromaGun 2 is set to build on the success of its predecessor, which received 'Mostly Positive' reviews upon its release in 2016. With a free demo available on Steam, players can experience the colorful chaos for themselves. As we look ahead to the future of puzzle games, one can't help but wonder: could this indie title be the spark that reignites the passion for the genre, or will it simply be another footnote in gaming history?
