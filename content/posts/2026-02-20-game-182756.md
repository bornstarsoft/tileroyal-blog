Kodansha Game Lab and Octorain have unveiled TrailRail, a captivating 2D action puzzle game set to launch on PC via Steam. This innovative game introduces a unique mechanic where players can materialize their movement trails with just a button press, transforming their paths into solutions for intricate puzzles. With a demo available during Steam Next Fest, gamers can get a taste of this fresh concept that challenges both intuition and creativity.

In TrailRail, players step into the shoes of Rail, a girl on a quest to uncover her lost memories while navigating through 38 engaging puzzles. The controls are refreshingly simple, limited to moving, jumping, and materializing trajectories. However, the depth of gameplay lies in how players creatively manipulate their surroundings using physics-based actions like pushing, pulling, and rotating. As you solve each puzzle, you not only progress through the game but also unravel the mysteries of Rail's origins and the world around her.

With its intriguing premise and innovative gameplay mechanics, TrailRail promises to be a standout title for puzzle enthusiasts. Will you be ready to embark on this journey of discovery and creativity?
