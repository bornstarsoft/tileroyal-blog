Battlefield 6 is set to implement significant tweaks aimed at enhancing the XP earning process and unlocking gadgets and weapon attachments. In a recent community update, Battlefield Studios revealed that players can expect a 10% increase in XP earned from match completions and a substantial 40% boost from daily bonuses. This means players will be able to unlock attachments almost twice as fast, addressing long-standing frustrations about the slow leveling process.

Moreover, the studio is adjusting the career ranks required to unlock certain assignments, bringing them down from ranks 20, 23, and 26 to 10, 15, and 20, respectively. This change is a direct response to player feedback regarding the challenges associated with these assignments, which unlock various cosmetic and gameplay content. Battlefield Studios is committed to making the progression experience smoother and more rewarding while maintaining a sense of achievement.

In addition to these XP adjustments, the studio is also tackling the issue of Portal servers being overrun by players farming XP. They are working on solutions to ensure that these servers can provide a more balanced gaming experience, emphasizing active play with friends rather than XP farming. As these changes roll out, players can look forward to a more engaging and rewarding experience in Battlefield 6.

As we await these updates, one has to wonder: will these changes truly enhance the gameplay experience, or will new challenges emerge? Stay tuned for more updates from Battlefield Studios.
