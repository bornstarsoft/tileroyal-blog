In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will go offline permanently in just one year. Following an announcement that the game would no longer be available for purchase, the official shutdown date is set for January 31, 2027. This decision marks a significant shift in Amazon's gaming strategy, as the company moves away from MMO development altogether.

As of today, New World has been removed from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store. Players will still have access to the game they purchased until the servers are taken offline, but in-game currency purchases will cease starting July 20, 2026. The developers have expressed gratitude to the community for their support, promising a memorable sendoff for the players who have invested time in the world of Aeternum.

The closure of New World raises questions about the future of MMOs and the gaming landscape as a whole. Will we see other titles follow suit, or is this a unique case for Amazon? As we approach the final year of New World, players are left to reflect on their adventures and what this means for the genre moving forward.
